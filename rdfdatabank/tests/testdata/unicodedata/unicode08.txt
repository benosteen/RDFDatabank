The following are the two first lines of the Analects by Confucius: <br>
 <br>
    子曰：「學而時習之，不亦說乎？有朋自遠方來，不亦樂乎？ <br>
    人不知而不慍，不亦君子乎？」 <br>
 <br>
    有子曰：「其為人也孝弟，而好犯上者，鮮矣； <br>
    不好犯上，而好作亂者，未之有也。君子務本，本立而道生。 <br>
    孝弟也者，其為仁之本與！」 <br>
 <br>
And here is the transcription of it: <br>
 <br>
    Zǐ yuē: “Xué ér shī xí zhī, bú yì yuè hū? Yoǔ péng zì yǔan fānglái, bú yì lè hū? Rén bù zhī, ér bú yùn, bú yì jūnzǐ hū?” <br>
 <br>
    Yóuzǐ yuē: “Qí wèi rén yě xiàodì, ér hàofànshàngzhě, xiān yǐ; bú hào fànshàng, ér hàozuòluànzhě, wèi zhī yóu yě. Jūnzǐ wù běn, běn lì ér dào shēng. Xiàodì yé zhě, qí wèi rén zhī bén yǔ!” <br>
 <br>
A rough translation might be: <br>
 <br>
    The Master [Confucius] said: “To study and to practice, it is is a joy, isn't it? When friends come from afar, it is a pleasure, isn't it? If one remains unknown and isn't hurt, isn't one an honorable man?” <br>
 <br>
    Master You said: “Few of the men who act well filially and fraternally are also fond of offending their superiors; men who are not fond of offending their superiors, but who like to cause trouble, such do not exist. The honorable man concerns himself with the foundations. Once the foundations are established, the Way is born. Is not acting well filially and fraternally the foundation of humanity?”
