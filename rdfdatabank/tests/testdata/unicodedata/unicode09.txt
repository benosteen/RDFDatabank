The following is the original (Tamil) name of a famous mathematician: <br>
 <br>
    ஸ்றீனிவாஸ ராமானுஜன் ஐயங்கார் <br>
 <br>
And here is a transcription of it: <br>
 <br>
    Sṟīṉivāsa Rāmāṉujaṉ Aiyaṅkār <br>
 <br>
Here there can be no translation, of course, since this is a proper noun. But I note that the mathematician in question (1887–1920) is typically named “Srinivasa Ramanujan Iyengar” in English.
