The following verses are lines 1182–1185 of the tragedy Oedipus Rex by Sophocles (in ancient Greek): <br>
 <br>
    Ἰοὺ ἰού· τὰ πάντʼ ἂν ἐξήκοι σαφῆ. <br>
    Ὦ φῶς, τελευταῖόν σε προσϐλέψαιμι νῦν, <br>
    ὅστις πέφασμαι φύς τʼ ἀφʼ ὧν οὐ χρῆν, ξὺν οἷς τʼ <br>
    οὐ χρῆν ὁμιλῶν, οὕς τέ μʼ οὐκ ἔδει κτανών. <br>
 <br>
Here is the transcription of it: <br>
 <br>
    Iou iou; ta pant' an exēkoi saphē. <br>
    Ō phōs, teleutaion se prosblepsaimi nun, <br>
    hostis pephasmai phus t' aph' hōn ou khrēn, xun hois t' <br>
    ou khrēn homilōn, hous te m' ouk edei ktanōn. <br>
 <br>
A rough translation might be: <br>
 <br>
    Alas! All would become clear. / O light, may I see you for the last time, / I who was born of these of which it is a crime to be born, who live with these / which which it is a crime to live, and who killed these whom I must not kill.
