In the following table, characters that are missing from Unicode as of version 3.0, latest draft (i.e. that cannot be represented as a single character but must use the more general form of combining diacritics) have been replaced by X, so you can tell they are not your browser's fault. <br>

Note that the three characters “LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH DOT ABOVE”, “LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH DOT ABOVE” and “LATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH MACRON” were not present in version 2.0 of the Unicode standard. So it is quite understandable if you do not see the corresponding entries.
