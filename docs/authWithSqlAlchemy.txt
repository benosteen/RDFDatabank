Using Pylons with SQLAlchemy
===================================================
sudo easy_install sqlalchemy
    SQLAlchemy-0.7.6
    sudo apt-get install python-sqlalchemy
    
sudo apt-get install mysql-server

sudo apt-get install libmysql++-dev

sudo easy_install MySQL-python
    MySQL-python 1.2.3

sudo easy_install repoze.what-quickstart
    This has repose.what, repoze,who, plugins.sa, plugins.sql and friendly-form.
    Since I already install some fo these packages, I will need to package repoze.what, plugins.sa and plugins.sql

    The other approach would be to modify the version number of repoze.who in quickstart and just go with one package
    I renamed the quickstart as quickstart 2.0 and modified the install requires. This seems like an easier approach

    sudo easy_install repoze.what-pylons
        repoze.what 1.0.9
    sudo easy_install repoze.what.plugins.sql
    sudo easy_install repoze.who.plugins.sa
    
    #Repoze.who version 1.0.19 gets installed. Remove thisand re-install repoze,who 2.0a4
    #Note: I need to check which of the above packages does this and not install it. Also is repoze.what-quickstart really needed?
    sudo rm -r /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/repoze.who-1.0.19-py2.6.egg/
    sudo easy_install repoze.who==2.0a4

# Create a database and a user for that database. See usingDatabase-databankauth.txt for instruction on doing so.
# Modify the mysql connection string in development.ini to match the database and user created
