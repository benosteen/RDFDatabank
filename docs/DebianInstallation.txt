Questions asked during Databank's installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Adminstrator Email Id - 
This will be used to send error messages from Databank to the administrator.

2. SMTP Server used to send email messages. The default value is localhost

3. Data storage location - the location where the data will be stored by Databank. 
	The default value is /silos

4. The base uri (domain name) of Databank
	Examples for this are: 
	Server name like                              http://example.com/databank/ or
	Ip address of the machine, if it has no cname http://192.168.23.131/  or
	Using localhost (development / evaluation)    http://localhost/ or 

	The default value is 'http://databank/'   

	This value is used in the following:
	* Each of the silos created in Databank will be intialized with the base URI
	* In each of the data packages, the metadata (held in the manifest.rdf) will 
	use this base URI in creating the URI for the data package
	* The links to each data item in the package will be created using this base 
	uri (aggregate map for each data package)

	If this base uri doesn't resolve, the links for each of the items in the 
	data package will not resolve

	The base uri is regarded to be permanent. Modifying the base uri at some
	point in the future will create all new silos and the data packages within 
	the new silos with the new base uri, but the existing silos and data packages 
	will continue to have the old uri.
	
5. The password for the administrator user of databank used by the web interface 
	for authentication and authorization.
	* The administrator has a default username as 'admin'. 
	* This user is the root administrator for Databank and has access to all the silos in Databank.
	* Please choose a strong password for the user

6. Choosing a password for the MySQL user
	Databank will install the MySQL database if it isn't alredy installed.
	A database with the name 'databank' will be create  during installation. 
	The database user 'databank' will also be craeted.
	You will be asked for a password for the user 'databank' and the credentials
	of the admin user of MySQL itself, so that the database and user can be created.

7. Confirmation if Databank can be configured for SOLR
	The search facility in Databank is powered by SOLR.
 
	If you choose to configure SOLR now, the existing schema 
	at /etc/solr/conf/schema.xml will be replaced with Databank's schema

	If you choose to configure SOLR at a later time, 
	the instructions to do so are at /usr/share/doc/databank/ConfiguringSOLR.txt
